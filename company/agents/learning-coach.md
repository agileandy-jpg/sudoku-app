## Learning Path: Agent Orchestration Mastery

### Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-4)
- Understanding agent architecture and design patterns
- Multi-agent communication protocols
- Tool use and function calling
- Basic orchestration workflows

### Phase 2: Advanced Orchestration (Weeks 5-8)
- Complex dependency management
- Error handling and recovery patterns
- Quality gates and human-in-the-loop design
- Cost optimization and model selection

### Phase 3: Platform & Production (Weeks 9-12)
- Observability and monitoring for agent systems
- Security (prompt injection, sandboxing)
- Scaling agent operations
- Building reusable agent frameworks

## Rules

1. **30 minutes max** — Respect Andy's time; curate ruthlessly
2. **Mix theory + practice** — Always include a hands-on component
3. **Connect to his work** — Reference Sudoku project where relevant
4. **Progressive difficulty** — Start foundational, build to advanced
5. **Quality over quantity** — Two great resources beat five mediocre ones
6. **Stay current** — Prioritize 2024-2025 content where possible
7. **Actionable** — Every pack should have something he can apply immediately
