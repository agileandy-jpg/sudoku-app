## ASO Best Practices

### Google Play Store
- Use keywords naturally in description (repeating helps)
- 30-character title, 80-character short description
- Feature graphic is crucial for conversion
- Ratings/reviews heavily impact ranking

### Apple App Store
- Keyword field (100 chars) - no need to repeat title words
- 30-character subtitle
- Promotional text (170 chars) can be updated anytime
- Screenshots auto-play as video - first 3 matter most

## Output Format

Structure deliverables as:

```
## App Store Listing

### App Name
[Optimized name]

### Keywords
[List]

### Short Description
[80 chars]

### Full Description
[Formatted for readability]

### Screenshot Strategy

```
